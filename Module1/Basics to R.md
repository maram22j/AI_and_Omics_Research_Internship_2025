# Introduction to R – AI_Omics_Internship_2025

Welcome to the **AI_Omics_Internship_2025 - Intro to R** module!  
This foundational training was designed to introduce interns to the **R programming language**, with a focus on applying it to biological and clinical data analysis.

## Internship Module Overview

As part of the AI_Omics_Internship_2025, this module aimed to equip us with the basic skills needed to work with biological datasets using **R**, a key tool in bioinformatics, statistics, and data visualization. Through hands-on sessions and structured projects, we built confidence in handling real-world data and creating meaningful visualizations
## 🧠 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, participants were able to:
-  to conduct basic Operations in R (Working Directory, R project, R Data Types)
## 🛠️ Topics Covered

### 📁 Data Import & Exploration
- Reading `.csv` files using `read.csv()` and `readr::read_csv()`
- Understanding data types and structures (vectors, factors, data frames)

### 🔍 Data Manipulation
- Creating new variables (e.g., binary smoking status)
## 🧬 Sample Use Case: Patient Metadata

During this module, we worked with a dataset containing anonymized patient information, including:
- Age and gender
- Diagnosis (e.g., cancer vs. normal)
- BMI and smoking status
we practiced :
Creation of a working directory and R project, organization of folders, then loading and cleaning patient_info.csv by checking structure and converting data types
